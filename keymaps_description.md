## glance.nvim

**Purpose**: Provides a prettier, floating window interface for viewing LSP information (definitions, references, implementations).

**Why useful for Go**: Essential for navigating Go codebases, especially for:
- Finding where functions/types are defined
- Seeing all places where a function/variable is used
- Finding all implementations of an interface (crucial for Go's interface-based design)

**Keymaps**:
- `<space>gd` - View **definitions** of symbol under cursor
- `<space>gr` - View **references** (where it's used) of symbol under cursor
- `<space>gi` - View **implementations** of interface/type under cursor

**Example workflow**:
1. Place cursor on an interface name (e.g., `io.Reader`)
2. Press `<space>gi` to see all types that implement that interface
3. Navigate through the floating window to jump to any implementation

**Configuration**: `lua/config/glance.lua`

## nvim-hlslens

**Purpose**: Enhances the search experience by showing match count and index (e.g., `[2/5]` means you're on match 2 out of 5 total matches).

**Why useful for Go**:
- Quickly see how many times a variable/function appears in a file
- Navigate between all occurrences easily
- When refactoring, see at a glance if you've updated all instances
- Essential for code review and understanding variable scope

**Keymaps**:
- `*` - Search forward for word under cursor (stays at current position, shows total count)
- `#` - Search backward for word under cursor (stays at current position, shows total count)
- `n` - Jump to next match (shows which match you're on: e.g., `[3/8]`)
- `N` - Jump to previous match (shows which match you're on)

**Example workflow**:
1. Place cursor on a variable name (e.g., `userID`)
2. Press `*` to search for all occurrences → Shows `[1/8]` (8 total matches)
3. Press `n` to jump to next occurrence → Shows `[2/8]`
4. Continue with `n`/`N` to navigate through all matches
5. Use for refactoring: verify you've updated all instances of a variable

**Configuration**: `lua/config/hlslens.lua`
