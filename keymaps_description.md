**Purpose**: Provides a prettier, floating window interface for viewing LSP information (definitions, references, implementations).

**Why useful for Go**: Essential for navigating Go codebases, especially for:
- Finding where functions/types are defined
- Seeing all places where a function/variable is used
- Finding all implementations of an interface (crucial for Go's interface-based design)

**Keymaps**:
- `<space>gd` - View **definitions** of symbol under cursor
- `<space>gr` - View **references** (where it's used) of symbol under cursor
- `<space>gi` - View **implementations** of interface/type under cursor

**Example workflow**:
1. Place cursor on an interface name (e.g., `io.Reader`)
2. Press `<space>gi` to see all types that implement that interface
3. Navigate through the floating window to jump to any implementation

**Configuration**: `lua/config/glance.lua`
