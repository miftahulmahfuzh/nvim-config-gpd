feat: add auto-formatting and enhance keymaps

Adds auto-formatting on save for Lua, Python, Go, and web development files (JS, TS, CSS) using stylua, ruff, gofumpt, and prettierd respectively.

Integrates mason.nvim, mason-tool-installer.nvim, and mason-lspconfig.nvim for automatic management of formatters and LSP servers.

New keymaps:
- `jk` to save and exit insert mode.
- `<leader>cd` to change CWD to the current file's directory and copy its full path.

Removes the now-redundant cursor blinking keymap.
